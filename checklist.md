# Project Checklist

## 1. Achieve 100% Unit Test Coverage
- [x] All modules (`engine.ts`, `feedback.ts`, `pieces.ts`, `scheduler.ts`, `ui.ts`) are fully covered by tests, including error and fallback logic.

## 2. Ensure Modularity and Maintainability
- [ ] Refactor complex logic into smaller helper functions as outlined in `next-steps.md`.
- [ ] Move reusable helpers to shared utility modules if appropriate.
- [ ] Document module boundaries and responsibilities in code comments and README.
- [ ] Review for code duplication and refactor to eliminate redundancy.

## 3. Use Expressive Naming for Private Functions/Methods
- [ ] Review and improve naming and documentation for all private helpers and methods as new helpers are extracted.

## 4. Track Progress on Helper Extraction
- [ ] For each module, list and check off helper extraction tasks (see `next-steps.md`).
- [ ] Mark as complete when all complex logic is refactored and documented.
