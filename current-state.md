# Current State Review

## 1. General Overview of the Project

This project appears to be a chess move trainer, likely designed to help users learn, practice, and memorize chess moves or positions. The presence of chess piece assets, a scheduler, feedback mechanisms, and a UI module suggests an interactive application, possibly web-based, that presents chess positions and tracks user progress. The use of TypeScript, Rollup, and Vitest indicates a modern frontend development stack, with attention to code quality and testing.

This project is specifically intended to serve as a template for generating Anki flashcards focused on chess openings, tactics, and strategies. As such, the build output in the `dist/` directory is kept minimal and simple to facilitate easy integration with Anki. Responsive design is a key requirement, supporting both desktop (multi-column layout) and mobile (single-column layout) use cases.

## 2. Current State of the Codebase

  - The codebase is organized into clear directories: `src` for source code, `styles` for CSS, `tests` for test files, and `playground` for HTML demos.
  - The `src` folder contains modules for core logic (`engine.ts`), user feedback (`feedback.ts`), chess piece management (`pieces.ts`), scheduling (`scheduler.ts`), type definitions, and UI rendering (`ui.ts`).
  - Assets for chess pieces are included in PNG format, supporting both black and white pieces, indicating visual board rendering.
  - Type definitions and ambient declarations are provided for chess-related libraries, supporting type safety and integration with external chess libraries.

   - The build process is designed to produce a simple, clean output in `dist/` for direct use in Anki flashcards.

  - Uses Rollup for bundling, ESLint for linting, and TypeScript for static typing.
  - Configuration files (`tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `rollup.config.mjs`, `Makefile`) are present and suggest a well-maintained build process.

  - CSS for board styling is present (`board.css`).
  - HTML playgrounds (`debug.html`, `index.html`) allow for manual testing and UI prototyping.
   - Responsive design is implemented to support both desktop and mobile layouts, as described in the README.

## 3. Current State of Unit Tests/Other Tests

- **Testing Framework:**
  - Vitest is configured for unit testing.

  - The `tests` directory contains:
    - `engine.spec.ts`: Likely tests core chess logic and move validation.
    - `index.smoke.spec.ts`: Presumably a smoke test for basic app functionality.
    - `setup.ts`: Test setup and configuration.
   - Unit tests are still being developed and refined. The presence of both unit and smoke tests indicates a focus on reliability, but overall coverage and depth are a work in progress.

## 4. High-Level Step-by-Step Checklist to Satisfy Project Goals

1. **Define and Document Project Goals**
   - Clarify the intended user experience, learning outcomes, and feature set, with a focus on Anki flashcard integration and responsive design.
   - Document requirements for move training, feedback, scheduling, progress tracking, and minimal build output for Anki.

2. **Review and Refine Core Logic**
   - Audit `engine.ts` for correctness in move validation and game state management.
   - Ensure `pieces.ts` and asset management support all necessary chess scenarios.

3. **Enhance User Interface**
   - Improve `ui.ts` for usability, accessibility, and responsiveness.
   - Integrate visual feedback and progress indicators.
   - Polish board styling and piece rendering.

4. **Expand Feedback and Scheduling**
   - Refine `feedback.ts` to provide actionable insights to users.
   - Enhance `scheduler.ts` to optimize training intervals and adapt to user performance.

5. **Strengthen Type Safety and Integration**
   - Review and update type definitions and ambient declarations for external libraries.
   - Ensure all modules are strongly typed and compatible.

6. **Increase Test Coverage and Reliability**
   - Expand unit and integration tests for all modules.
   - Add edge case and regression tests.
   - Automate test execution in CI/CD pipeline.

7. **Optimize Build and Deployment**
   - Review and streamline build scripts and configuration files.
   - Ensure efficient bundling and asset management, with a focus on producing a minimal `dist/` output for Anki.
   - Prepare for deployment (web, desktop, or mobile as appropriate).

8. **Document Codebase and Usage**
   - Write comprehensive documentation for developers and users.
   - Include setup instructions, API references, and contribution guidelines.

9. **Assign Tasks and Track Progress**
   - Break down checklist into actionable tasks for individual developers.
   - Set up issue tracking and project management tools.
