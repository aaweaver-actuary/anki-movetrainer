# Current State Review

## 1. General Overview of the Project

This project is a robust chess move trainer for Anki flashcards, with responsive design and a modern TypeScript stack. All major robustness, type hygiene, and test coverage goals have been met. Defensive lines and fallback branches are explicitly tested. Minor lint errors have been resolved.

## 2. Current State of the Codebase
- All modules are type-safe and covered by tests.
- Code is ready for refactoring to improve modularity and helper function extraction (see `next-steps.md`).
- Responsive design and minimal build output for Anki are implemented.

## 3. Current State of Unit Tests/Other Tests
- 100% unit test coverage for all modules, including error and fallback logic.
- Vitest and ESLint are fully integrated and clean.
